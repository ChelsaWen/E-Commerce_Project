## There are 7 datasets(tables) for the entire project
## During data exploration, duplicate payment were found in datasets "Payments' and "Price"
## Figure out the actual transaction amount for each order before EDA

-- Check duplicate order in dataset "Payments" 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM payments;
SELECT COUNT(order_id) FROM payments;
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateOrder
FROM payments
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>1;
## 2961 orders have duplicate payments in Table dataset "Payments"

-- Check duplicate order in dataset "Price" 
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateOrder
FROM price
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>1;
## 9803 orders have duplicate payments in dataset "Price"

-- Investigate duplicate payments in dataset "Payments"
SELECT * FROM payments ## (vouchers*3(22.49*4 = 89.94) + credit card(17.78) = 107.72)
WHERE order_id = "ea9184ad433a404df1d72fa0a8764232";
## The reason with duplicate payment is that some customers pay by multiple methods(vouchers/credit card/...) for 1 order
## The amount in "payment_value" column includes freight fee, so it is not the actual value of the order itself

-- Determine the actual sales of the orders in dataset "Price"
SELECT * FROM price ## only 1 product in this order (price:$89, freight:$18.72 = 107.72)
WHERE order_id = "ea9184ad433a404df1d72fa0a8764232";
## Actual sales should be calculated using the "price" column in dataset "Price" which excludes freight price
